Simple project to analyze aspects of a dataset using dbt. The dataset is Adventureworks,
one of the classic sets for learning data analysis. It simpulates a bicycle repair shop. It
contains enough tables and data to enable robust and interesting analysis, without being
overwhelming. It can be downloaded here: https://github.com/lorint/AdventureWorks-for-Postgres

The code does three analyses, the results of which are in the following tables in the 'dbt' schema:
inventory_by_model_id - total inventory on hand broken out by product model
cost_of_inventory_by_location - total cost to buy or produce all inventory at each location
discount_per_quarter - difference between list price and actual selling price
  for all saleable products for which records exist, broken out by product and quarter
